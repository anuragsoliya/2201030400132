           As you continue to focus on your breath, thoughts, sensations, and emotions may arise. Instead of trying to push them away or get caught up in them, simply observe them with a sense of curiosity and non-judgment. Acknowledge their presence and then gently guide your attention back to your breath.

           Your mind may wander away from your breath repeatedly. This is normal. Each time you notice your mind wandering, gently bring it back to the present moment. You can use a mental note like &#34;thinking&#34; to label your thoughts and then return to focusing on your breath.
